Orient RCU was founded early 2019 by three founders, who are young but ambitious Vietnamese health researchers. Since then, the Unit has been operated by a team of young and enthusiastic people, who are passion for health research. We are receiving supports and advices from established international and Vietnamese researchers and leaders. To achieve our goals, we set up and maintain links with health researchers who are working at research organizations and health facilities in Vietnam and other countries.
